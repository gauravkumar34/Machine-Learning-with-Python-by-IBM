 Question 1	Supervised learning deals with unlabeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with labelled data.
	True


 Ans-	False


 Question 2	Which of the following is NOT TRUE about Machine Learning?


	Machine Learning was inspired by human being learning process.


	Machine Learning models iteratively learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights.


	Machine Learning models help us in tasks such as object recognition, summarization, and recommendation.


  Ans-	Machine learning gives computers the ability to make decision by writing down rules and methods and being explicitly programmed.

 Question 3	Which of the following groups are not of Machine Learning techniques?


	Classification and Clustering


 Ans -	Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-Learn


	Anomaly Detection and Recommendation Systems

  Question 4	"Regression" technique in Machine Learning is a group of algorithms that are used for:


 Ans-	predicting a continuous value, for example predicting price of a house based on its characteristics.


	prediction of class/category of a case, for example a cell is benign or malignant, or a customer will churn or not.


	finding items/events that often co-occure, for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a customer.

 Question 5	Comparison of supervised with unsupervised learning, is this sentence TRUE or FALSE?

	In contrast to Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning has more models and more evaluation methods that can be used in order to ensure the outcome of the model is accurate.


 Ans-	FALSE


	TRUE
