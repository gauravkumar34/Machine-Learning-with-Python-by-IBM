1. Question 1
Multiple Linear Regression is proper for:


Predicting the sales amount based on month


Predicting whether a drug is effective for a patient based on her characterestics


>>Predicting tomorrow's rainfall amount based on the wind speed and temperature

2. Question 2
What one is the meaning of "Out of Sample Accuracy" in the context of evaluation of models?


>>"Out of Sample Accuracy" is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that the model has NOT been trained on.


"Out of Sample Accuracy" is the accuracy of an overly trained model (which may captured noise and produced a non-generalized model)

3. Question 3
When we should use Multiple Linear Regression?


>>When there are multiple dependent variables


When we would like to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on a dependent variable.


When we would like to predict impacts of changes in independent variables on a dependent variable.

4. Question 4
Which of the following options are TRUE about Polynomial Regression?


>>Polynomial regression can use the same mechanism as Multiple Linear Regression to find the parameters.


>>Polynomial regression models can fit using the method of Least Square method.


>>Polynomial regression fits a curve line to your data.

5. Question 5
Which sentence is NOT TRUE about Non-linear Regression?


Nonlinear regression is a method to model non linear relationship between the dependent variable and a set of independent variables.


For a model to be considered non-linear, y must be a non-linear function of the parameters.


>>Non-linear regression must have more than one dependent variable.
